Welcome to the Hister documentation. Hister is a web history management tool that provides blazing fast, content-based search for visited websites.

## What is Hister?

Unlike traditional browser history that only searches URLs and titles, Hister indexes the full content of web pages you visit. Keep your data private and local while enjoying powerful search capabilities.

Hister consists of two major components:
 - **Binary executable**: Providing indexer, web interface and command line tool
 - **Browser extenison**: Sending visited websites and opened results to the indexer
